# Introduction to Exploiting Web Applications

According to [Douglas Crockford](https://crockford.com/), former distinguished architect of Internet behemoths PayPal and Yahoo! before that, &ldquo;The Web is the most hostile software engineering environment imaginable.&rdquo; Given that it&rsquo;s hard enough to make Web applications work in the first place, is it any surprise that so many of them can be broken, hacked, and exploited? Of course, it&rsquo;s often not good enough merely to break some system. Our task is to make the system break in *specific* ways that will be useful to us.

This exercise will introduce you to the [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)](https://www.zaproxy.org/), a free and open source Web application security scanner. We&rsquo;ll cover Web application security basics, including ZAP&rsquo;s configuration, target scoping, and more. We&rsquo;ll be targeting the [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/), an intentionally vulnerable practice target that has a slew of common Web vulnerabilities to learn about. The most common of these vulnerabilities are collectively known as the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). They include SQL injection, sensitive data exposure, cross-site scripting (XSS), broken authentication and access control, and many others.

Today&rsquo;s World Wide Web has become a worldwide battleground, economically, militarily, and culturally. By knowing how the Web-based systems we all use&mdash;or even build!&mdash;can be made to fail in just the &ldquo;right&rdquo; way, we can better protect ourselves and our organizations from the constant barrage of attacks flying across the Internet. This exercise provides an opportunity to learn how to hack your own Web sites and applications before your opponents do so you can find your own vulnerabilities and shore up your own defenses before your adversaries get the chance to exploit them.

# Bill of materials

This folder contains the following files and folders:

* `Blue Team/` - Git submodule that should contain the OWASP Juice Shop source code. If this directory is empty, be sure you have fetched this repository's submodule contents by running `git submodule update --init`.
* `README.md` - This file.
* `Red Team/` - Provisioning files for the attacker machine.
* `Vagrantfile` - The Vagrant configuration for our practice target (the &ldquo;Blue Team,&rdquo; which in this case is an [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) instance), and our attacker machine.

# Prerequisites

To perform this lab, you must have:

* A computer running any modern version of:
    * Windows,
    * macOS,
    * FreeBSD,
    * Solaris, or
    * any flavor of the GNU/Linux operating system.
* An active Internet connection (for downloading the required tools in the [set up](#set-up) step, as well as Vagrant base boxes, and the required software packages into the virtual machines; you do not need an Internet connection once you have completed the set up portion of this lab).

> :beginner: :computer: This exercise requires the use of a command line, or "terminal." If you don't know what that means, or if you do but you feel intimidated by that, consider going through [Tech Learning Collective&rsquo;s free, online and self-paced *Foundations: Command Line Basics* course](https://techlearningcollective.com/foundations/), spending an hour at [Apple's Terminal User Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/) (for macOS users), [Ubuntu's Command Line for Beginners tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners) (for GNU/Linux users) or reviewing [Computer Hope's article, "How to use the Windows command line (DOS)"](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm) (for Windows users) if you want to get started quickly. You don't need to complete the whole tutorial or article to understand this exercise, but it will dramatically improve your comprehension of this exercise's mechanics. If you want a more thorough but equally gentle introduction to the same material, consider reading (and listening to) [Taming the Terminal](https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/blog/taming-the-terminal/).

# Set up

In addition to your laptop or desktop computer, you will need to acquire the following tools.

* For managing the virtual machines: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) version 6.1 or newer, sometimes written as *VBox*.
* For automatically configuring virtual machine settings: [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com/) version 2.2.7 or newer.

Complete the [Introduction to Virtual Machine Management with Vagrant](../introduction-to-virtual-machine-management-with-vagrant/README.md) practice lab before this one if you do not yet have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed or are unfamiliar with how to use them.

Then, bring the virtual machine(s) for the lab online.

**Do this:**

1. Boot both virtual machines needed for the lab:
    ```sh
    vagrant up
    ```

Once both the virtual machines are running, you can continue to the next step.

# Practice

We'll begin by ensuring you have successfully completed the [set up](#set-up) steps. This process will also introduce the fundamentals that you need to understand to complete the rest of the exercise.
